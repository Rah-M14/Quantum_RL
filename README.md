# Quantum_RL
Quantum Computing (PL3001) - Sem 6

Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant success in various domains but faces challenges when applied to quantum systems due to their inherent complexity. Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) seeks to address this by marrying RL techniques with the power of quantum computing. This project aims to analyse and compare the performance of different RL algorithms within the framework of QRL, utilizing the capabilities of TensorFlow Quantum (TFQ)
